# OCR Model for Handwritten Text Recognition

This OCR model is a deep learning-based solution for recognizing handwritten text. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from input images and a fully connected layer to classify the recognized text.

## Overview

This project is a handwritten text recognition model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is designed to recognize English characters and words in handwritten text images.

## Features

* Recognizes handwritten text images with high accuracy.
* Trained on a large dataset of handwritten text images.
* Uses a CNN architecture for accurate and efficient recognition.
* Can recognize both individual characters and full words.
* Includes a GUI for easy user interaction.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.x
* OpenCV
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Installation

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Run the "Custom OCR w TF.ipynb" file

## Results

* The model achieved an accuracy of 88% on the test dataset. PLUS: It can also detect spaces.
